#May the 4th be with these organisms, always :)

#The average merit of dominant organisms at the end of the run for Baseline Treatment in 2-4-PaperDuplicationWMod
#was about 28000. I think this would probably hold fairly constant over the baseline treatments for any experiment
#since they'd all have the same parameters, but run_1530 of Baseline-Treatment for the full replication had no final
#detail file at 200000 updates and the merits for run_1531 were more around 14000. So, this might be a parameter that's
#hard to actually get right. Perhaps this experiment won't work well, but who knows? We can try. Each task will be
#rewarded by 28000/9 or thereabouts.
