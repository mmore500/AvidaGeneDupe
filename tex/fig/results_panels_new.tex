  \caption{\textbf{Slip-scramble and slip-duplicate treatments facilitate adaptive evolution.}
  \small Violin plot show distribution of the phenotypic adaptation scores for final dominant genotypes.
  Time series show progression of phenotypic adaptation score along lineages of final dominant genotypes;
  color-coding corresponds to violin plots.
  Asterisk (*) markers indicate treatments with significantly higher phenotypic adaptation scores compared to baseline.
  Simulation time unit is ``updates,'' corresponding to evaluation of approximately 30 genome sites per organism.
  Data shown from second-phase experiments.
