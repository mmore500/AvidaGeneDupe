  \textbf{Slip-duplicated sites are overrepresented among \textit{de novo} coding sites for complex traits.}
  \footnotesize
  Distributions compare frequencies of previously slip-duplicated and non-slip-duplicated sites among  \textit{de novo} task coding sites, normalized to neutral expectation.
  Values greater than 1 indicate that sites are overrepresented among the coding sites of novel traits compared to their background frequency.
  Differences between slip-duplicated and non slip-duplicated sites are significant for tasks requiring 2 or more NAND components (Mann-Whitney test; $p < 0.01$).
