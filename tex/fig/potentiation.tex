  \textbf{\textit{De novo} coding sites for complex traits are overrepresented in slip-duplicated regions.}
  \footnotesize
  Distributions compare enrichment of coding sites for novel logic-9 traits in slip-duplicated regions, normalized to neutral expectation.
  Values greater than 1 indicate that coding sites of novel traits occur more often in slip-duplicated regions compared to their background frequency.
  Each observation is enrichment of coding sites density within slip-duplicated regions at the first occurence of each observed trait; observation counts are 48, 56, 59, 52, and 20.
  Significance of deviation from null expectation median value of 1.0 is indicated with * ($p < 0.05$), ** ($p < 0.01$), or *** ($p < 0.001$) (one-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test).
